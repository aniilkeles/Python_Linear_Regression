# Weather Conditions in World War Two - Temperature Prediction

This project focuses on predicting weather temperatures during World War II using historical climate data. The goal is to compare different regression techniques and evaluate their performance using Cross Validation.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle**. It contains weather data recorded during WWII from various weather stations across the globe.

## 🛠️ Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** - Performed via **IDE** to ensure high-quality data.
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering:** - Created new features and transformed existing ones to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Selection:**
   - Applied multiple regularization techniques to prevent overfitting:
     - **Ridge Regression**
     - **Lasso Regression**
     - **Elastic Net Regression**
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Used **Cross Validation** to ensure the stability and reliability of the predictions across different data subsets.

## 🚀 Results
The models were compared based on their prediction accuracy, and Cross Validation results provided a robust performance metric for each algorithm.
